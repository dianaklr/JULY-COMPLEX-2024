<p><strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong> (/ˈmærəlɪn mənˈroʊ/; born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926 – August 4, 1962) was an American
    actress and model. Known for playing comic "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blonde_stereotype#Blonde_bombshell">blonde bombshell</a>" characters, she became one of the most popular sex
    symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s, as well as an emblem of the era's sexual revolution. She was a top-billed
    actress for a decade, and her films grossed $200 million (equivalent to $2 billion in 2023) by the time of her death
    in 1962.[3] Long after her death, Monroe remains a pop culture icon.<sup>[4]</sup> In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked
    her as the sixth-greatest female screen legend from the Golden Age of Hollywood.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in a total of twelve foster homes and an
    orphanage[5] before marrying James Dougherty at age sixteen. She was working in a factory during World War II when
    she met a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career, which led
    to short-lived film contracts with 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures. After a series of minor film roles, she
    signed a new contract with Fox in late 1950. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in
    several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't
    Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photographs prior to
    becoming a star, but the story did not damage her career and instead resulted in increased interest in her
    films.</p>
